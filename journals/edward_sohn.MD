## Journals

Please keep all of your individual journals in this directory.

Each team member is required to keep a development journal, which should be a single markdown file with an entry for each day the project was worked on.

Recommended naming convention is `first_last.md`.

As a group, we implemented our first migration table for users. David was the driver and we helped navigate him to create a user table with rows: id, first_name, last_name, email, phone_number, address, city, state, username, password, avatar_url, is_driver, car_model, license_plate, and DL_number. The appropriate parameters were included as well. We assigned the primary key to the user.id as user_id.

## 3/30/23

As a group, we implemented the users query schema. I was the driver and everyone else helped me create the UsersIn, UsersOut, and UsersOutWithPassword models.
