## 3/30/2023 - Work on authentication using HackR library and migration files

Today, I worked on:

- Worked on updating project for authentication files from jwtdown-fastapi library
- Made some small updates to query schema for hashed_password items we missed
- Updated migration tables to reflect changes in query schema

This was a big copy paste job, but also important to understand what is happening under the hood.
We have successfully added, but not tested, so I will likely attempt this weekend.

This has been a big week and my group taught be how to access and check settings in my vscode, so
I don't need to format as much, which I'm very grateful about.

## 3/29/2023 - Finalizing wireframe, API Endpoints

Today, I worked on:

- Worked on almost finalizing the api endpoints in team google xcel
- Made some small updates to query schema for date_created items we missed
- Updated migration tables to reflect changes in query schema

There have been some growing pains in what is expected from everyone on the team. We are
just starting the project, so everyone wants to be involved, but there's a layer of trust
that needs to be built among everyone. Once we get passed this project setup, I'm confident
we'll be able to perform more efficiently.

We tried to plan that we'd need extra education time on our own, but it doesn't seem to be
enough to grow confidence. I wish Hack reactor had an entire day to docker compose setup and
transitioning between a virtual environment to docker compose or vice versa. We only did it
during our microservicing a Django monolith and it's difficult to remember.

## 3/28/2023 - QuerySchema, Migration

Today, I worked on:

- Worked on almost finalizing the query schema in google sheets for our project
  with the team
- Worked on almost finalizing Migration tables in google sheets for our project

As a team, I think we learned a lot about workflow and already have lessons learned
on how we would start again. We thought the wireframe could be come up with as
we go along, but we found ourselves with a small blocker to what our actual deliverable
was, so we came full circle.

It's important to agree on a true MVP and wireframe deliverable, so everyone on the team
knows what we are working towards. Being Agile means to build the agreed upon deliverable
in working sections. I need to get better at testing code.
