Helped Timi Navigate the set up of the Docker-compose.yaml file

Created 2 volumes:

- byob-data
- pg-admin

Created 3 services:

- byob-service ->
- ghi -> React stuff
- postgres -> SQL database

Implemented **001_users_migration.py** into **migrations** folder, under the **byob-service**

```
<!-- insert sql stuff here -->
```
